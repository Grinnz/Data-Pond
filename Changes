version 0.003; 2010-10-20

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * in XS, use newSVpvs() and sv_catpvs_nomg() wherever appropriate

  * in XS, use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT for efficiency

  * also test POD coverage of pure Perl implementation

  * in Build.PL, explicitly set needs_compiler to avoid bogus
    auto-dependency on ExtUtils::CBuilder

  * add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 0.002; 2009-11-04

  * bugfix: in XS implementation, avoid memory leak when parsing hashes

  * port to Perl 5.11, supporting new first-class regexp objects in
    type checking

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

version 0.001; 2009-05-15

  * bugfix: correct flags on exported regexps (lack of /x caused these
    regexps to match the wrong things, but did not affect parsing with
    pond_read_datum())

  * initial released version
